# Assignment Overview: Lab for Class 14

### Goal 1: Finish up BusMall

- Ensure that all functionality is in place
- Make it look fantastic!
- Refine all aspects of UI/IX (instructions, layout, clarity, etc.)
- Add any additional charts/data functionality you think might be useful
- Maybe find ways to add some CSS animations?

### Goal 2: Let's Make an Order Form & an Open Orders page

We're going to adapt of the stretch goals from Wednesday and build a small stand-alone project with it.

This is a paired assignment, but we will use a different workflow. One member of the pair will create a repository and then set the partner as a collaborator to that repo. That means that both of you will have privileges to push and merge to that repo.

Create one repository called 'order-form' and both clone it to your laptop, and create the following files: index.html, orders.html, app.js, and style.css. You will want/need to import some things from BusMall into this project.

Your index.html is for customers: it will have an order form for BusMall that will have the following inputs:
  - A dropdown menu of all BusMall products
  - An input of "type=number" to indicate quantity to purchase
  - Text inputs for each of name, street, city, state, ZIP code, and phone number
  - An input of "type=number" to enter a 16-digit credit card number
  - A "But Now" button to submit the order. When the order is submitted, all of the input fields should be cleared
  - Of course, there should be appropriate instructions and styling on the page

  Your orders.html form will display the orders in the BusMall warehouse.
  - It should list all orders currently unfilled with a picture of the item.
  - Each order should have a button "Filled" that will remove that order from the DOM when it is clicked.
